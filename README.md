## [Some Project Features](https://github.com/Porgramming-Hero-web-course/b8a11-client-side-NafizUddin)

There are some features in this project. Here I have provided some of them:

- Dark/Light Theme Toggle - There is a button in the top right corner which enables the toggle between light and dark mode. This feature is implemented on the whole website.

- Add Books to Database - There is a `Add items` route and in that route, we will get a form to add book data in the database. This form contains the information of various kinds of books.

- Borrow Book - There is a button named `Borrow Book` in Book details page which adds the functionality of adding particular Book to the Borrow Book Page. If the book is already borrowed, then it shows a error message. If it's not been borrowed yet, then it will pop up a dialog form and the user has to provide input borrow date and return date. Then the user can borrow the book.

- Update Books to Database - There is a `Update Books` button in each card of All Books Page which redirects to a form to update the info of that book.

- Borrowed Books Page - There is a `Borrowed Books` route in this website. A user will find the books which he/she has borrowed. In that page, there is a `Return` button and if the user want to return any book, this button enables opportunity to delete the item.

- Authentication - There is a `sign in` button in the navbar. By clicking the button, it will lead the users to a sign in form. By putting the registered email and password, they can login and enjoy all features of website. Once they get signed in, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar. The users can also login to website with `Google` or `Github` by clicking the logos and those logos are in the bottom of the Sign in form.

  Those who are first visitors to the website, they have to register first to see all the contents of the website. They will find an option to create account in the bottom of login form. By clicking that option, they will go to `Sign Up` page. Once they get signed up, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar.
